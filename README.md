## 🚀 About Me

I’m an **Embedded Software Engineer** passionate about pushing the boundaries of hardware–software interaction. With hands-on experience in **MCU firmware, embedded C/C++, FPGA design (VHDL), and IoT systems**, I enjoy architecting innovative solutions—from batteryless medical monitors to secure IoT devices.

Currently studying **Electrical Engineering (Co-op)** at the University of Waterloo, I’m most excited about **GPU programming, FPGA architectures, and real-time embedded systems**!
